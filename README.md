## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:  
  - Next.js with TypeScript
  - Shadcn (UI components)

- **Backend**:  
  - Next.js (Server Components)
  - Neon PostgreSQL (database)
  - Prisma (ORM)

- **Data Engineering**:  
  - Pandas (data transformation)
  - Seaborn, Matplotlib (data visualization)

- **Data Science**:  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature extraction
  - Predictive modeling (recommendation system)

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure registration and login for administrators and employees.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage events, user registrations, and view organizational metrics.
- **Data Analytics**: Generate reports and insights on employee performance.

## Data Engineering

The data engineering component of the project involves:

- **Data Ingestion**: Using Prisma to interact with the Neon PostgreSQL database to manage employee and training data.
- **Data Warehousing**: Pandas is used to store and process large volumes of data, providing a platform for advanced analytics.
- **Data Transformation**: Pandas is utilized to automate and standardize data transformation processes, enabling efficient analytics.

## Data Science

The data science component focuses on:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing employee skill data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Feature Extraction**: Transforming raw data into meaningful features for machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Development**: Creating predictive models, including a recommendation system that suggests relevant training events based on employee skills.
